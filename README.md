**!! THIS IS A FORK BY beamyyl, ALL CREDITS GO TO HIM. I JUST ADDED A FEW THINGS THAT MADE MY LIFE EASIER**

required apps: i3 i3status dmenu xorg any_terminal_emulator picom xclip

optional but recommended apps: i3blocks i3lock brightnessctl xwallpaper

!! If using Pulseaudio instead of Pipewire, comment the pipewire lines and uncomment the pulseaudio files in the i3/config file !!


**PROBABLY not gonna update anymore, since I use hyprland BTW now**
